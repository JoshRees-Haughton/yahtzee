# yahtzee
A terminal based, single player Yahtzee game

Note that when selecting the dice to reroll during a turn, the numbers input correspond to their position in the line of five dice, not the value of the dice.

Planned improvements:

1. Allow player to play multiple games in a row.
2. Implement other Yahtzee Joker rules, with the ability for the player to be able to choose 
   (see "Yahtzee bonuses and Joker rules" in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee).
